#### Welcome to the 113th course in magic. My name is Joffery Baggins, Elf Sorcerer Extraordinaire. You see that castle? I live on the top floor. In this course, we will learn how to build websites and apps. Websites and apps are the magical infrastructure that the world of humans runs on. 

# Challenge One. Entry Test

## [W3 Schools. Animation and Colors. Entry Test](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_animation1)

We are going to test your skills. Click on challenge one and open the editor. Don't let the simple colors fool you! We will look at websites of stunning beauty later. 

## Test One

- Change the colors from red and yellow to navy and teal, or orange and green. Whatever you desire.

## Test Two

- Make the animation slower. Hint, look for some numbers. 


## Codepen. Background Colors. 

Did you get it? Good. W3 schools is useful but the colors are a little ugly, right. So lets go to Codepen.

Much prettier, right?

https://codepen.io/Teeke/pen/yWbWwW

In the W3 schools example, the colors were written red, yellow, green, blue etc. These are good but often a little too bright and ugly for modern tastes. 

Check out lines 27 to 30. Play with the numbers you see. Try changing #fff to #f22. See what happens. Webdev is about experimentation.
