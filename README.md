#### Hey Kids,

#### Welcome to the 113th course in magic. My name is Joffery Baggins, Elf Sorcerer Extraordinaire. You see that castle? I live on the top floor. In this course, we will learn how to build websites and apps. Websites and apps are the magical infrastructure that the world of humans runs on. 

# [Challenge One. Entry Test](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_animation1)

We are going to test your skills. Don't let the simple colors fool you! We will look at websites of stunning beauty later. 

- Change the colors from red and yellow to navy and teal, or orange and green. Whatever you desire.
